# ‚õÖ Estes-Park-Weather-Prediction

A data-driven project focused on analyzing weather data in Estes Park to develop simulation models for predicting future weather conditions. This model can forecast weather for specific days or months, providing insights that support local planning and decision-making.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Process and analyze over 3,281 historical data points to uncover correlations and patterns, focusing on temperature and humidity.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build a simulation model to forecast daily and monthly weather conditions with up to 30% enhanced accuracy, aiding in local event and resource planning.
- **Key Insights**: Identify significant weather patterns, such as the inverse relationship between temperature and humidity, to refine future predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Detailed Weather Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis of historical weather data to reveal trends in temperature, humidity, and other indicators.
- **Predictive Simulation**: A flexible prediction model allowing users to specify a day or month for weather forecasting, useful for both short-term and long-term planning.
- **Correlation Insights**: Use patterns, such as the negative correlation between temperature and humidity, to improve prediction accuracy, especially for humidity.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Data Analysis**: Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (optional for advanced models)
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn

## üöÄ Current Development Status

This project, Estes-Park-Weather-Prediction, is a foundation for building a predictive model that forecasts weather conditions in Estes Park. The primary goal is to analyze historical weather data and develop a simulation model capable of predicting weather for specific days or months, ultimately improving local forecasting accuracy.

`Note: The core weather prediction model is currently in development. This project provides the initial data analysis and groundwork, but further work is needed to build and fine-tune the prediction capabilities.`


## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap

- **Enhanced Visualization**: Integrate interactive graphs for better data exploration.
- **Additional Climate Variables**: Include factors like wind speed and precipitation to improve model accuracy.
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Expand the model to account for seasonal variations.
